# Detection of Abusive Comments in Social Media Using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting abusive and hateful comments in social media using deep learning techniques. The aim is to develop effective classification models that categorize online comments into three categories:  
- Hate Speech  
- Normal  
- Offensive  

By leveraging Neural Networks (NNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), this system achieves high accuracy in identifying abusive language.
